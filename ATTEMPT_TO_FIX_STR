Trying to fix the STR issues, I found ths link and tried some new code added this to the very beginning 
.ORIG x3000
       
       AND   R1, R1, #0 ; Clear R1
       AND   R2, R2, #0 ; Clear R2
       LD    R3, ASCII ; Load ASCII difference
       LEA   R4, START_TIME ; LOADING THE START TIME BLKW TO R4
       LEA   R5, END_TIME ; LOADING THE END TIME BLKW TO R5

so I load the blocks and store the blocks into r4 and r5 
then I store the input into those registers that have the blocks

START  LEA   R0, PROMPT_START ; Load prompt for start time
       TRAP  x22               ; Display prompt
       TRAP  x23               ; Request keyboard input for start time
       STR   R0, R4    ; Store start time input in memory ; THIS IS NOT WORKING
       ; ^ SHOULD STORE THE INPUT FROM USER INTO START_TIME BLOCK

       LEA   R0, PROMPT_END   ; Load prompt for end time
       TRAP  x22               ; Display prompt
       TRAP  x23               ; Request keyboard input for end time
       STR   R0, R5      ; Store end time input in memory  ; THIS IS NOT WORKING 
       ; ^ SHOULD STORE THE INPUT FROM USER INTO END_TIME BLOCK
